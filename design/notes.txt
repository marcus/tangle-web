DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Partial syncs should be no problem
Syncs should not rely on a system of record
Realtime / collaborative updating should be built in
Should support partial sync (client only needs a subset of the data)


Gathering:
On A:
- Everything with no sync date
- Everything (with "modified_at" or "deleted_at" after "last_sync with client B") (either on the record itself or global)

On B:
- Everything with no sync date
- Everything (with "modified_at" or "deleted_at" after "last_sync with client A")
